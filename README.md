# Vision-Transformer-ViT-PyTorch-Replication
PyTorch project about replicating the Vision Transformer (ViT) from the paper “An Image is Worth 16x16 Words.” It builds the model from scratch, covering data setup, patch embedding, and visualization to demonstrate how Transformers can process images for classification.
