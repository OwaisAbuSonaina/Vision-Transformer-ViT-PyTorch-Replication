>  A clean, modular replication of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model in **PyTorch**, built from scratch to explore how Transformers can perform image classification.

---

## 🧩 Description

This project re-implements the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture as introduced in the seminal paper:
**“An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale”**
The goal is to **understand and reproduce** the model’s building blocks — from patch embeddings to data pipelines — and demonstrate its function on a simple image classification task.

> 🔍 *Built for learning, clarity, and experimentation.*

## 🚀 Overview

The notebook/code performs the foundational steps in building a Vision Transformer:

* **Environment setup and dependency handling**
* **Dataset acquisition and DataLoader creation**
* **Step-by-step implementation of Equation (1): Patch Embedding**

This stage focuses on **transforming input images into token sequences**, just like words in NLP — the first step of making Transformers see.

## 🧠 Core Concept: Vision Transformer (ViT)

The **Vision Transformer** adapts the **Transformer** architecture (originally made for text) to **visual data**.
It works by:

1. **Splitting images into patches** — like dividing a sentence into words.
2. **Embedding each patch** into a vector representation.
3. Feeding the sequence of embeddings into a **Transformer encoder** that learns relationships between image regions.

Would you like me to automatically include installation & usage instructions (like `pip install -r requirements.txt` and a short example of how to run the script)? They’d make the README feel like a fully usable repo instead of just documentation.
